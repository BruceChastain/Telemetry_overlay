# Telemetry_overlay

This project is not finished and likely wont be for a long time. The main goal of this app is a overlay gps data over cycling videos. 

To use this app put your .gpx file and the python file in the same dir. By the way I made this in python 2.7. 
From there launch the app by writing "python arg1 arg2 arg3"... alright I can't finish this read me right now.
